üíµARIMA Time Series Model for Exchange Rate Forecastingüí±

üí∞Project Objective

Forecasting the future trends of exchange rates is crucial for making informed financial decisions. The aim of this project is to predict future movements in exchange rates using machine learning and data analysis techniques based on historical exchange rate data.

ü™ôProject Scope

This project focuses on collecting USD-TRY exchange rate data for a specified period from various financial sources. The collected data, with fundamental attributes such as date and exchange rate values, will be meticulously examined using financial analysis techniques to identify significant trends, patterns, and events during the specified period. Subsequently, the results of the data analysis will be processed and trained by a machine learning model. The model will be centered on predicting the changes in USD-TRY exchange rates during the chosen period. Finally, the forecasting results obtained from the machine learning model will be presented to the user visually and numerically, which may include exchange rate graphs, statistics, or text formats.

üí≤Project Structure

1- Understanding the Dataset:

The project begins by exploring and understanding the USD-TRY exchange rate dataset. This involves an examination of the dataset's size, attributes, and general statistics.

2- Data Preprocessing:

The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing or inconsistent data. This step includes filling in missing values, removing unnecessary attributes, and transforming data types to make the dataset more manageable.

3- Visualization:

Data visualization is a crucial step in the analysis process. Time series graphs, price changes, and other significant features will be focused on to extract meaningful insights. Popular Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be utilized for visualization.

4- Machine Learning Model Development:

The project involves developing a machine learning model using the information obtained from data analysis and visualization. This model will focus on predicting USD-TRY exchange rate changes during the specified period. Popular Python-based machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow can be employed.

5- Presentation of Prediction Results:

The forecasting results obtained from the machine learning model will be presented to the user visually and numerically. In this step, exchange rate graphs, statistics, or text-format reports can be used to demonstrate the accomplishment of the project's initial objectives.

üö©About the Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about the fluctuations in USD-TRY (United States Dollar - Turkish Lira) exchange rates. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

Date: The date on which the financial data is recorded.
Open: The opening price of a financial instrument on a given date.
High: The highest price reached by a financial instrument during a specific time period.
Low: The lowest price reached by a financial instrument during a specific time period.
Close: The closing price of a financial instrument on a given date.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, accounting for events such as dividends or stock splits.
Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded during a specific time period.

üìèAnalysis Perspectives

The perspective of this analysis encompasses a comprehensive examination of historical trends and future predictions regarding the USD-TRY (United States Dollar - Turkish Lira) exchange rate. The analysis delves into a detailed study of financial data, identification of trends and patterns, and utilizes machine learning techniques to process this data for predicting future exchange rate movements.

The dataset used in the project includes various financial attributes such as date, opening price, closing price, lowest and highest prices, and trading volume. The analysis aims to understand and explain exchange rate movements using these attributes.

The analysis perspective includes the following key elements:

1- Historical Analysis: With the dataset containing historical information, the analysis provides a retrospective view. This involves a detailed examination of past exchange rate movements, significant events, and their impacts on the exchange rate.

2- Trend Identification and Pattern Analysis: The analysis identifies trends and patterns in financial data to utilize this information for forecasting future movements. Techniques such as technical analysis, charts, and statistics are used to attempt predicting possible trends in exchange rate values.

3- Machine Learning-Based Predictions: The analysis involves developing a machine learning model using past data. This model leverages learned patterns and relationships to offer a perspective on predicting future exchange rate values.

The analysis perspective aims to provide users with information to make informed financial decisions by focusing on understanding how financial data has changed over time, identifying significant trends, and evaluating potential scenarios for the future.
